The dataset was released by Aspiring Minds from the Aspiring Mind Employment Outcome 2015 (AMEO). The study is primarily limited  only to students with engineering disciplines. The dataset contains the employment outcomes of engineering graduates as dependent variables (Salary, Job Titles, and Job Locations) along with the standardized scores from three different areas â€“ cognitive skills, technical skills and personality skills. The dataset also contains demographic features. The dataset  contains  around  40 independent variables and 4000 data points. The independent variables are both continuous and categorical in nature. The dataset contains a unique identifier for each candidate.
